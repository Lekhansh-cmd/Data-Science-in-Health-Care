## Introduction
ELISA is a commonly used laboratory test to detect antibodies in the blood. An antibody is a protein produced by the body's immune system when it detects harmful substances, called antigens. This project works as the basics of analyzing ELISA test by showing how to prepare and make statistical analysis of the collected information about IgG and IgM, vaccination influenza, vaccination tuberculosis and other diseases and blood groups.


## Objectives
 After completing this project you will be able to: 
- Download test datasets (Excel files .xlsx) to use them in Python
- Automatically clean and prepare data in dataset
- Transform the table
- Visualize data with Pandas and Seaborn, two very popular data analysis and visualization libraries 
- Statistical Analysis: Minimum and maximum values, Averages, Quarters, and create pivot tables
